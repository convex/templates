# Convex + TypeScript + Next.js + Clerk + Tailwind + shadcn/ui

This template provides a minimal setup to get Convex working with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/). It uses [Clerk](https://clerk.dev/) for user authentication.

Start by editing `convex/myFunctions.ts` and interact with your Next.js app.

See Convex docs at https://docs.convex.dev/home

## Setting up

```
npx create-convex@latest -t nextjs-clerk-shadcn
```

Then:

1. Follow steps 1 to 3 in the [Clerk onboarding guide](https://docs.convex.dev/auth/clerk#get-started)
2. Paste the Issuer URL as `CLERK_JWT_ISSUER_DOMAIN` to your dev deployment environment variable settings on the Convex dashboard (see [docs](https://docs.convex.dev/auth/clerk#configuring-dev-and-prod-instances))
3. Paste your publishable key as `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY="<your publishable key>"` to the `.env.local` file in this directory.

If you want to sync Clerk user data via webhooks, check out this [example repo](https://github.com/thomasballinger/convex-clerk-users-table/).
